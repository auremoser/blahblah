Apropos to today’s push to ‘spring ahead,’ this episode themes around Daylight, all of the lovely springtime connotations munged with the bummer of losing another stolen hour to this new season. I’ll bridge the more quotidian Daylight songs with some Ultra, Spot, Still and Invisibly prefixed light, and round out the music with some references to [A Day’s Close](http://www.amazon.com/At-Days-Close-Night-Times/dp/0393329011) and [Barry Lyndon](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0072684/) on lighting in a few other media. Stay tuned for my typical smatterings of the Smiths, Mirah, Thundercat, and J*Davey.
