This episode is about books, not the band "The Books" (though they're featured) and not the Book of Love, though it <strong>book</strong>-ends this episode (see what I did there?). It's more about music written about books and written with the same visceral and awesome intent as when we wrote on animal hide or plants, once living and then recycled for more learning. Enjoy!
