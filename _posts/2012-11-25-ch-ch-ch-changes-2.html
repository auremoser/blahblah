<p>Bob Dylan played his show and I thought I’d follow with a two-part episode taped back to back while I’m away in Sing[along]apore for Siggraph Asia. This episode loops through all the transformations of changing, from game changing to chunks of change, [ex]changes to changelings. There will be some warbling Dylan crooning crowned with an echo of high school chansons cycling through some french and fun electro PoP.</p>
