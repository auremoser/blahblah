This week's archive is an abbreviated one because we messed up the sound. So, unintentionally you'll be waiting for the wait episode until we figure it out! In the genre of absurdist theater, we designed an episode to focus on those waiting-for-godot-esque moments of today, including all of the intermediary wait times that punctuate our otherwise exciting adventures.
