This follows from a special episode series of Stereo Semantics broadcasts from [Radio Colmena](http://www.radiocolmena.com.ar/) at the Matienzo Cultural Club in Buenos Aires, Argentina. It'll be featuring a bilingual broadcast of songs about computers, castellano/ingl√©s. You can look forward some references to Daisy and `say` programming, as well as robot computation and pocket calculators. We'll run the gamut of programming refs from the top of the internet to the bottom of tech stack.
