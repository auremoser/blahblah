<p>For the opening episode of this series, I’ll feature songs themed to navigate the open/close binary. Stereo Semantics is all about echoes of relationships around a pivot point, so you’ll hear pairs of electronic musicians and croony chorals, coupled with rap and indietronica that tease out the varied meanings of &nbsp;”open” and “close.” in all parts of speech. I’ll bookend with the opening titles and ending credits from Wale’s <em>Mixtape about nothing</em>, and focus on <strong><span style="color:#800080;">Rhye’s <em>Open</em></span></strong> as the title track.</p>
