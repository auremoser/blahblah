This is an episode about age; is youth preferable to the wisdom of experience, which of the two bears out the pejoratives attached to it? We'll talk a bit about what it means to be young (or geong, or jungas) and what it means to transition from that state. Julian will be making his debut as my cohost for the season and we'll iterate through some indie, shoegaze, and jam band tunes about youth or of our youth, as the case may be.
