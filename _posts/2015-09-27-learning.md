This episode picks up with the start of the Fall Semester, with a focus on how we **learn** through music. We'll bookend the episode with some hyper-recent source and cover pairings courtesy of Perfume Genius and The National. It will follow through some folk and french pop, punctuated by some classical music aligned with the theory of Suggestopedia, and learning through melodic priming. Enjoy!
