From some more recent interactives and <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/g/gun_control/index.html">news about gun control</a>, this episode is about our rights to information, articulated in songs about open arms and some of the less-loaded references to guns in our lives. Apolitical and without necessary agenda, it traces some tracks about elephant guns and plushguns, open armories and armistice.
