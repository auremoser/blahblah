<p>In my obsession with palindromes and semantic undertones, vowelplay and voyeurism , I made a show about sex, in all of its misspellings, awk mutations and unintuitive idioms. I’ll take a tour through significations of sex and Saussurian theory, echoing out some french electro pop and brooklyn indie rock, jewish rap and 8bit Sex Ba-Bomb. There’s some Sex@Six and Sex Sux for symmetry, some jam bands and love sounds for good measure. An episode that will smother you in comical smut. Enjoy.</p>
