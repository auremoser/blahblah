This week's episode takes off from the research theme of last week's learning episode to discuss different approaches to "easy" music, that is music inspired, borrowed, swiped or stolen from others. We'll start with Son Lux's Easy and wrap up with Halsey's sample of that same peace, playing some Aussie/Kiwi music with Troye Sivan, Gotye and Fat Freddy's Drop on the way.
