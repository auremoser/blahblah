Inspired by [World Maps without New Zealand](http://worldmapswithout.nz/), this episode tries to recognize some of the brilliant music coming out down under. It features Australia-theming and artists across genres, including Swoop Swoop, Snakadaktal, and Bon Iver/Beirut with a special focus on **Perth**, one of the oldest and most stellar cities of light on the planet.
