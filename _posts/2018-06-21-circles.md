After a long hiatus, a chill Circle-themed Stereo Semantics! Hosted at the 2018 Circle of HOPE (Hackers on Planet Earth), this Radio Statler co-production features a mixture of security-themed tracks (from Cardi B's _Invasion of Privacy_ to Silent Circles's pseudo-80s tunage) bookended by a source-cover pairing of "Private Eyes." Tune in and chill out, we'll bring you "full circle" through a pretty epic suite of house, pop, rap, indie and electronic music.
