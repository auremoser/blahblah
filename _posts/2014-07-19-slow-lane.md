A special edition of Stereo Semantics broadcast live on [Radio Statler at HOPE X](http://radio.hope.net/).

This episode's theme is slowness. We talk alot about internet slowlaning, and the slow data trend. The FCC was forced to extend the deadline this week for [public comments on their Internet Slow Lane plan](http://www.fcc.gov/page/fcc-establishes-new-inbox-open-internet-comments) to midnight last night, so it seemed topical to address this at Hackers on Planet Earth, among internauts and their discontents. You'll hear some indie rock, psych/synth pop and electronic remixes with some cameos by comcast throughout this special episode of stereo semantics, the HOPE-10 slow lane edition.
