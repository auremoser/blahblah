Special sleepytime edition of stereo semantics. Post-thesis for me, this episode will be a celebratory play with volume. I’ll start with the Smiths #uszhe from Louder than Bombs, ‘Asleep,’ naturally, and then run through a few loud tracks punctuated by some musical piano/pianissimo lulls until I can lullaby you through some quieter acoustics until final relaxation. :)
