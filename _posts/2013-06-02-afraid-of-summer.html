Afraid of Summer

Weaving in my aforementioned Algorhythmic plans, this episode starts and ends with some solid Math Rock, courtesy of Battles and Gloss Drop/Dross Glop. This Summer Swell Season kickstarts with lots of Ice Cream, Idyllic Drive-in Theaters and Rollerskate Summer Sugar with Matias Aguayo and Muscles on demand. Listen in for some Summer songs, camp nostalgia, Guns Babes and Lemonade where possible.
