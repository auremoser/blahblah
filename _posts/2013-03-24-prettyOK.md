This week celebrates the anniversary of the introduction of OK into print parlance via the Boston Morning Post. I’ll explore some possible and gestural meanings of ‘oll correct,’ mixing some spoken word tracks courtesy of OK and the Books, mixing in some stand-up soundbites and wordsmithing rap courtesy of Kitty Pryde and Messy Slick. Intro promises to play out some of the more obscure references to Ok and A-OK gestures, and the closing wraps it all in some aural catharsis typical of ASMR.
