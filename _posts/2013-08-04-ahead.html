Inspired in part by Singularity and Ordinal Linguistic Communication, or a way of applying personality to ordered items, this episode treats the ways we apply hierarchy and personality to our physical systems. Starting with Radiohead and ending with Jadiohead, I’ll cycle through a suite of songs about human bodies and principally favored parts. “Heads” dominate culturally as “positive” parts as they do semantically in song titles. This is an episode about getting [a]head, and untangling the spiritual syntax of syncretism and synaesthesia, as it applies to our human selves.
