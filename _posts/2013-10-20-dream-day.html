We've been planning an episode for oneironauts for a while, due to the glut of songs relevant to this topic, we split the episode into two thematic treatments (Daymares and Nightmares). Each offer the typical anecdotes punctuated by sweet and relevant tunes, from Fleetwood Mac to Radiohead, The Monkeys to The Mamas and the Papas.
