<p>on october 14th, the birthday of edward estlin cummings (aka ee cummings), i decided to dedicate my show to a day that google doodle forgot. in honor of a remarkable radical bohemian poet, polemic politics and personality aside, I assembled a set list that started with “us” and traversed refs to his autobiography The Enormous Room (1922), then lily-padded through his “no thanks” (1935) with a few anticon and punk rock gems. thereafter there i echoed out some allusions to his love affairs and Fairytales (1965), wrapping up with some rives slam poetry and young weezy.</p>
