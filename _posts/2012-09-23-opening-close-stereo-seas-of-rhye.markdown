For the opening episode of this series, I’ll feature songs themed to navigate the open/close binary. Stereo Semantics is all about echoes of relationships around a pivot point, so you’ll hear pairs of electronic musicians and croony chorals, coupled with rap and indietronica that tease out the varied meanings of  ”open” and “close.” in all parts of speech. I’ll bookend with the opening titles and ending credits from Wale’s Mixtape about nothing, and focus on Rhye’s Open as the title track.
