As the last episode of the season, and the last regular episode for a hot minute while we take a summer break from Stereo Semantics, this episode is appropriately themed for Stars and Finishes. I'll go over some of the etymology behind those words for beginning and ending, and then chat through some artists old/new who contributed to the "start of something" or the "finish line" of our perspective on music from the 60s, 80s, and most recently, this month.
