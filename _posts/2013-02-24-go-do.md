March is a stretch of peculiar business balanced by an impulse to do all of the things. So this episode is about going and doing, about how we go about managing time, our primary non-renewable resource. It bridges Hall and Oates with some “go”-focused tracks, mixing some motivational idioms and pop-punk faves to the tune of our most organic unit of time: human heartbeats.
