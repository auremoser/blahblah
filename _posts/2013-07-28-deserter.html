This is an episode about weaving webs of connections across distances. What does “distance” and “remote,” mean to us? Unachievable or further afield -feasible? Does a Desert Island inspire paradise or paranoia? Does distance mean safety or solitary separation? A bit inspired by an article about spiders spinning their protein silk to connect extremes, I’ll talk about our fascination with desert islands and distance, and the etymology of both to tease out what they might meet to the Twilight Zone and to us today.
