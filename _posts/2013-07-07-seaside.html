Lucid dreams of sea-escapes brought this episode to questioning the semantics of “sea” as distinct from lake or other water bodies. I’ll talk about the Salton Sea (both album and rift lake), seas as descriptors of the 17th century “unknown” and colloquial open space of simultaneous exploration potential and escape from civil society. Lots of love for Salt Cathedral, The Thermals, The Dodos, Neutral Milk Hotel and Islands, from Phil Phillips to Cat Power.
