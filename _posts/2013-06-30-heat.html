Given the summer stroke and current heat condition in NY, his episode dabbles in the socio-psych of temperature, in the violent tendencies of hot weather and heavy humidity. From electronic to no-wave to noise rock, artists have dabbled in heated songs and violent poetics and this episode pulls in some Violens, some City Light, some Hot Chip and Hella to craft a playlist appropriate for our current heated condition.
