Uncharacteristic but still applicable, this episode takes on the most pro-lific prefix in the english language: un-. The preface constituent of so many words, suggesting both negation (‘undeclared’) and unity (‘united’), singularity (‘unicorn’) and articulation (‘un‘ as an article in latin-based languages). This strings together otherwise unrelated but similarly started words, verbles, phrases and euphemisms (‘untruth’ vs. ‘lie’ anyone?). All this bookended by the Magnetic Fields’ “Underwear” and rounded out by some discussions of grammar and great adventures in [projection mapping to the tune of remix](http://www.stereogum.com/59171/magnetic_fields_offer_their_underwear_to_puma/franchises/commercial-appeal/).
