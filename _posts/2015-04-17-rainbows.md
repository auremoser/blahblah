This week's theme, _rainbow_ is a joyous compound term pretty dear to my heart; built on myriad mythologies and scientific phenomena, the rainbow is a marvel of our world. Its name implies a diversity in its spectrum of shades and it's modern-day symbolism, and likewise I'll be running through a variety of rainbow types and rainbow tropes in music. This arcs (appropriately, as an arc-en-ciel) into an explanation of the wonders one might expect at the end of the rainbow, in most traditions where it is recognized as a bearer of brilliance, wealth, and the promise of beauty despite an inaccessable terminus.
