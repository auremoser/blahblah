Patty Smith served as inspiration for this episode about kids; her memoir "Just Kids," tells the story of growing up artistic in New York, and of her 22-year friendship with Robert Mapplethorpe. This episode starts with the little orphan annie version of "Hard-Knock Life" and weaves through a strange pattern in cross-genre music making that includes songs incorporating kids' voices in the chorus. At times ethereal, at times unsettling, children provide music with an undertone of nostalgia and innocence, from MGMT to Kid Cudi.
