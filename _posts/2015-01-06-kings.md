This special episode of Stereo Semantics broadcasts from [Radio Colmena](http://www.radiocolmena.com.ar/) at the Matienzo cultural center in Buenos Aires Argentina. We'll be featuring a bilingual broadcast of songs about Kings in honor of Reyes Magos, 3 Kings day. You can look forward to some Icelandic tunes from √Åsegir to Of Monsters and Men and some local Los Gatos, all building on the royal theme.
