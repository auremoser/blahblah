Inspired by wooden nickel aphorisms and my newfound obsession with Bitcoin currency, this episode is about how we monetize in music. Iâ€™ll play some Blood Bank EP + the catch Kanye remix and run through some other Wood  themed music, along with a few references to other economies, bankrupture, and getting lost in the sometimes abrasive but always awesome transactions/transitions between of  bubble gum pop  and Patti Smith, psychodelectrontic tunes and indie rock jams.
