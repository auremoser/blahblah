Inspired by the <a href="https://socialmediaweek.org/blog/2015/04/oregon-trail-generation/" target="_blank">Oregon Trail Generation</a>, this episode covers various genres and songs from the "Greatest Generation" to the "Founders." We'll wind through all forms of rock, prog, post, alt, plus some of its genre complements and successors. Enjoy, and sort yourself to a new generation based not on birth year, but on the basic tunes of your fav decade.
