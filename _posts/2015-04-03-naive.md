Naive is a term from the 1650s, meaning "natural, genuine; just born; foolish, innocent; unspoiled, unworked," literally "born, innate, natural." This episode will pair my favorite rendition from The Kooks and a cover group, on the topic of Naiveté. You'll here some of the innocence in Hanna’s Theme by the Chemical Brothers from the Hanna film soundtrack, about a young girl who is trained as an assassin. This is an episode about innocence and nativeness and nativity and being foolish and just born...so there will be a little shoutout to Bob Dylan-esque poetry with some spoken word about OCD and some pretty epic instrumentals, and well as some indie rock... _naturally_.
