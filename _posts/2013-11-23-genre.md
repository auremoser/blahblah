A rather meta-episode of Stereo Semantics, this is one about genre-changing covers, that particular art of the remix which transcends musical type an really invigorates older notes with new life in another musical approach. We'll explore the rhapsody of poetry and music as complimentary disciplines as well as the fusion with other academic domains that results in true genius in history as in song production. Tune in for Bohemian Gravity, Dolly Parton, and Heartbeats ++.
