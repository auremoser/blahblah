To celebrate a bit of our creative thinking, obsession with recursion, and topsy turvy perspective on all of the things, this episode is about inversion. We'll explore reverse-themed tracks, musical palindromes and lyrically backward songs that investigate both sides of binaries. As per uszhe we'll start with a song and end with it's cover, it's own echo-inverted format to support this opposite theme.
