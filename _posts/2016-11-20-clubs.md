The history of clubs is pretty complex, sometimes strangely stratified by gender or background, or quixotically constructed as a way to get like-minded people together. This episode was inspired by the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/07/nyregion/to-create-a-quieter-city-theyre-recording-the-sounds-of-new-york.html?_r=3" target="_blank">Society for the suppression of unnessary noise"</a>, and will tease out what sorority, and fraternity, and masonry and all the aptly ended -y words that mean commraderie and community in club music.
