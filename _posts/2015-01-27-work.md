This the fourth of a special episode series of Stereo Semantics broadcasts from [Radio Colmena](http://www.radiocolmena.com.ar/) at the Matienzo Cultural Club in Buenos Aires, Argentina. It'll be featuring a bilingual broadcast of songs about work/trabajo, castellano/ingl√©s. You can look forward some more classic music from Moris, Kate Bush and Men at Work as well as some more contemporary Mynabirds and Mompox. Punctuated by some clips from Coffitivity and Perfect Service, you'll be set for a productive hour of working it out with us in music. :)
