Kickstarting after a long radio hiatus, we've dedicated this episode to links and chains, part of the foundation of this show, the cosmic connections between songs and their authors. We'll feature some Fleetwood Mac cutups, a few Chainsmokers remixes and some Small Black/Depeche Mode for good measure. Enjoy!
