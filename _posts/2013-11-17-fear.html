In line with the 1 word themes of the past few weeks, Fear brings us to a catalog of phobias and musical approaches to being afraid. Tune in for some Blue Ã–yster Cult, Lily Allen and the Album Leaf, as well as other artists with unique approaches to creature fear, fear and loathing, pity and fear, or whatever other terms combine well with one of the most common and visceral of human emotions.
