This special episode in a series of Stereo Semantics broadcasts from [Radio Colmena](http://www.radiocolmena.com.ar/) at the Matienzo Cultural Club in Buenos Aires, Argentina. We'll be featuring a bilingual broadcast of songs about Animals, castellano/inglés. You can look forward to Jónsi and Juana Molina, Miguel Abuelo and Animal Collective followed by a little pocket of midwestern music courtesy of Headlights, Zola Jesus, and the loveable Andrew Bird. Special shoutout to the Olinguitos in the audience!
