<p>In the shadow of the Orionid meteor shower this weekend, this episode of stereo semantics pays tribute to the mystery and magic of the heavens. I’ll start with some punchy pops and whistles and pushing into some preemptive CMJ tracks, all with touches of elysium, shangri-la, paradis, or whatever you equate with post-mortem peace. With some apocryphal mathematics and some shoutouts to the great books, i’ll be your Beatrice, guide you up the 9 circles of ‘hello world’ to your gangster’s paradise.</p>
