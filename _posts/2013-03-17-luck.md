On this St. Patrick’s Day, Stereo Semantics takes it theme from a day devoted to luck and charm. I’ll run through three layers of song-remixes while playing through a few lady luck, lucky number, and synchronous/serendipity tracks, all arranged according to the laws of chance. Tune in for some Tough Alliance, Magnetic Fields, Jamie Woon, James Blake  and otherwise rad tunes to stimulate that part of your prefrontal cortex that parses happy accidents and processes your luck in lottery of our everyday.
