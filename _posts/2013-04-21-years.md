Last episode marks a year since the genesis of stereo semantics, so here comes everybody: RaRaRiot, Ratatat and all your favorite mellifluous onomatopoeia plus a bunch of french pop and “year” fixated crooners. I’ll break a year down in increments of 10,000 hours and other indices of productivity and proficiency, and round it out with a look at 2014, our soon-to-be new year.

Thanks for listening, stay tuned for summer stereo semantics!
