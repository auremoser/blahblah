This follows from a special episode series of Stereo Semantics broadcasts from [Radio Colmena](http://www.radiocolmena.com.ar/) at the Matienzo Cultural Club in Buenos Aires, Argentina. It'll be featuring a bilingual broadcast of songs about constellations, castellano/ingl√©s. You can look forward some references to Red Hypergiants, Champagne Supernovas and star births/deaths; as well as some celestial-themed bands and star-crossed canciones.
