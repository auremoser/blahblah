In honor of this February’s holiday, this episode is about all of the myriad meanings of love. How we miss or make the mark with melodies, and what all of these musical metaphors do to define love for us. I’ll cycle through a few explicit definitions and some more suggestive allusions, doctor up the allegories that rival all implementations of this most mysterious of emotions. Help from the doors and daft punk, Phoenix and Muscles, bookended by Birdy and Bon Iver.
