This follows from a special episode series of Stereo Semantics broadcasts from [Radio Colmena](http://www.radiocolmena.com.ar/) at the Matienzo Cultural Club in Buenos Aires, Argentina. It'll be featuring a bilingual broadcast of songs about cities, castellano/ingl√©s. You can look forward some references to certain cities and more generic urban environments in general.
