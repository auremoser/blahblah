Inspired by the TAL Breakup Song and a bit of brilliance from Philip Glass, this episode is about the etymology of “breaking,” both positive and negative. What does it mean to make a line <br/> in code, to break up, to break a horse, to break a leg…colloquially, connotatively? This episode will explore breakage and its source and tributaries.
