This house-hunters episode goes into some of the etymology of oikos and "home," with home-spun song stylings of the folky-variety and indie-alt rock in equal/agreeable measure, it traces from one home to another cover and tip-toes through the likes of Zoe Boekbinder, Beach House, Fleet Foxes and Forget Cassettes.
