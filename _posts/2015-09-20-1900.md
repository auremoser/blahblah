First episode of the new season calls for some epicness, this episode thus tackles and entire century, the 1900s. All songs are themed with titular reference to the 1900s, from Phoenix to Phox and Frankie Valli to Chet Faker, this stereo semantics travels through time to loop back to 1901 with the final cover.
