This episode was dedicated to one of our most heavily trafficed but underloved facilities globally, the airport. You'll listed to some airport and airplane-themed tracks, completed with some tracks that inaugurated the birth of ambient music, and others that just escape the mundane aspects of our transitional spaces all-together. Enjoy.
