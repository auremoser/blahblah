This Father’s Day edition of Stereo Semantics takes on our paradigm of the father, the hero. This episode explores the heroism we inherit from an unpretentious and unexpected parentage. What we consider courageous and worth congratulation on this Father’s Day. I’ll play some heroic anthems mixed with some social commentary on identity and nature/nurture vis-a-vis paternity with the help of Gil Scott-HEROn some sick electrophunk and neo-psychedelic tunes.
