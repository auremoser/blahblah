This the third of a special episode series of Stereo Semantics broadcasts from [Radio Colmena](http://www.radiocolmena.com.ar/) at the Matienzo Cultural Club in Buenos Aires, Argentina. It'll be featuring a bilingual broadcast of songs about acronyms and messages, castellano/ingl√©s. You can look forward to SOS and IDGAF adn HSKT from the argentinian, icelandic and swedish set. Much of the abreviations and messages we take for quotidian are actually cryptic and of interesting or unknown origin, let's tease them out for an alto episodio of SS.
