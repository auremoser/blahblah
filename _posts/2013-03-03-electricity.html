Electricity is in the news, so topical and ubiquitous, I just had to do an episode to test your capacitor for electronic songs. Brighten your night with some brilliant Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark galvanized by some Battles and Belle & Sebastian. Iâ€™ll loop through some electronic music as well and punctuate with soem rad refs to electronic installations at Dorkbot and Art Hack Day.
