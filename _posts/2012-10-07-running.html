<p>Many people have asked me to come up with a running playlist <img src="http://s0.wp.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(">  . I’d probably run to electro-euro-pop, so I’ll spare everyone that episode and take a more semantic/inquisition approach. As a <a title="No idea" href="http://i2.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/234/146/bf8.jpg">non-runner</a>, I’ll parse out the many meanings of a “run” and make it maximally accessible. So this for all the runaways and the people who run with it, the people <a title="Running after antelopes" href="http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/80/running-after-antelope">running after antelopes</a> and everyone else racing to the finish. This is also for the great universal everyone, since we’re all running out of time.</p>
