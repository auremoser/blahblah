The last episode of an era of Stereo Semantics! Had to be epic, so the theme was space. Starting with David Bowie's Space Odyssey and come compilation electromagnetic mixes, we traversed the genres from the mid-century space-race magic of the 1960s through the way-contemporary cosmic tunes of the 20-teens. Learn about <a href="http://history.nasa.gov/wakeup%20calls.pdf" target="_blank">NASA wakeup calls</a> and Voyager mission music, and much more spaaace-tastic tuneage. Enjoy!
