Recent press about PRISM and government agency activity in the States inspires this episode framed by two interpretations of Valerie Plame. We'll hear some indie and brit rock on the topic, populating the space between with a series of "spy" songs and iSpy book references, "secret" messaging systems and covert affairs. Enjoy for a dose of The Doors, The Decemberists, Massive Attack and sneaky spy banter.
