<p>Bob Dylan is <a href="http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/07/19/bob-dylan-to-play-at-barclays-center-in-brooklyn/">playing a show</a> at the Barclays Center on the 21st of November; I’m not a fan. ‘Tis the season to give thanks and be thoughtful, so I taped a two-part episode that dissects my [dis]interest in Dylan, and thinks through some of the applications of alrightness to our pop culture via some Peggy Lee, Icelandic crooning, Pains of Being Human Television and the Tallest Man on Earth, capped creatively (and surprisingly by Ke$ha). Bonus track: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w-58hQ9dLk">this melodica cover</a>.</p>
