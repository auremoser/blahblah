Apropos to the date, this is an episode about Soulful music to suit All Soul’s day,  part of triduum of days known as the Hallowmas which consists of Halloween, All Saints day and All Souls day. Historically in France, this latter day is celebrated as a commemoration day for the dead, with burial fraternities decorating churchyards and leading graveyard processionals. The English supposedly had a pastime called “souling," a kind of caroling/trick or treat, and as there’s some discussion about these as hybrid holidays between religions, we'll talk about some music that cuts to the soul and references spiritual life, however rubber, however dark, however close to the body, bookended by some Ben Harper and Michelle, my Belle.
