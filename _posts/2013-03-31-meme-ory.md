In the wake of some media mnemonics and the push to Spring, this episode themes around our pop culture and pop music tendencies vis-a-vie cultural memory, or perhaps more appropriately meme-ory. With a catalog of film references to the persistent fear we have of forgetfulness (Memento, Total Recall, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, Danny Boyle’s new Trance), it seems that tv’s Black Mirror is pioneering a new twist, what happens when you remember everything? What is our issue with memory and what memories does audio enable us to commit to musical memory? from RaRa Riot’s Do You Remember, to Low’s slowcore I Remember and a suite of french tracks from Charlotte Gainsbourg (Don’t forget to forget me) Air (Remember) and the not-french-but-sounds-like Noisettes (Never Forget You), I’ll be playing tracks that echo our title and ending remix of Forget it (orig. Blood Orange, 2011) by remembering only the most awk, painful, and emo moments of our lives.
