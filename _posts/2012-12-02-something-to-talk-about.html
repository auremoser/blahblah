<p>Because I dig symmetry and this is the last episode of the season, I thought I’d theme it as ‘something’ since I opened the seaz with a Mixtape About Nothing. As such, this episode is a slurry of the Smiths, Spoon, Daft Punk and Brit Pop bookended by the Beatles. I’ll sequence through the “starts of something” and dive into all the somethings that append our most nebulous and often delightful of nouns. Until next season fans!</p>
