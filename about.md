###This Show
Stereo Semantics is a radio show based on the semantic web, and that 70s show [Connections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connections_(TV_series)). It\'s a show about the relationships between songs and artists, and the general interconnectedness of creative work. Each episode starts with a song, ends with its cover, and plays songs that connect the two, based on a theme. The episode title and description explains the theme, embedded mp3s archive the show, and linked tracklists and RelFinder Maps help you understand the relationships.

###This Site
This is a base [Jekyll theme](http://jekyllrb.com/); we added some weirdness because we are weird++. Every season is different, so check them all out! News stuff everyday, some of it broken but all of it jazzy. If you want to see where I used to store everything, check out [algorhyth.ms (under Projects > Radio)](http://aureliamoser.com/projects/radio/). Spoiler: it\'s not as cool.
